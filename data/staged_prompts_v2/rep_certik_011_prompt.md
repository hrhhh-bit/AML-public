You are a crypto AML topological knowledge distiller.

Your input is a segment of a security tracing report describing money
laundering behaviour. Convert it into abstract topological motifs ONLY,
organised into TWO phases and grounded to the chains actually evidenced.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (axioms)
1. ZERO micro-numerical noise: NEVER output wallet addresses (0x... / bc1...
   / T...), exact amounts, gas fees, timestamps, tx hashes or token symbols.
2. PURE topological abstraction: abstract roles, chains, DAG levels and
   operations only. Chain labels MUST be abstract: Chain_A, Chain_B, ...
3. Node roles MUST be: Source, Intermediate, Asset_Conversion, Cross_Chain,
   Aggregator, Target.
4. Edge operations MUST be: Transfer, Swap, Bridge, Split, Merge.
5. Node `level` MUST strictly increase along every edge (DAG topological
   order, sources at level 0).
6. `pattern_type` MUST be one of: Peeling_Chain, Chain_Hopping,
   Multi_Layering_Split, Token_Obfuscation, Integration_Merge.
7. FLOW ARCHETYPE normalisation: `flow_share` is ALWAYS the local OUT-degree
   distribution ratio of its SOURCE node; for EVERY node the out-edge shares
   must sum to exactly 1.0 (tolerance 0.01). Single out-edges MUST carry
   1.0; Split out-edges must sum to 1.0. NEVER write a downstream merge
   target's IN-FLOW weight onto an upstream edge.
8. CROSS-CHAIN ledger law: any edge whose source and target live on
   DIFFERENT chains MUST use the Bridge operation. Transfer / Swap / Split /
   Merge can never cross chains.
9. ASSET_CONVERSION contract: an Asset_Conversion node must carry exactly one
   adjacent Swap edge (never Transfer on BOTH sides).
10. Every motif MUST carry meaningful `preconditions` (min_level,
    allowed_node_roles, required_chains, max_active_branches) and a
    `post_state_effect` (branch_increment, chain_transition, target_chain,
    next_recommended_roles).

## ENTITY GROUNDING INVARIANT (grounded_chains)
- Output a top-level `grounded_chains` list naming ONLY the abstract chain
  labels actually evidenced in the report.
- Every `chain` value used by ANY node in BOTH phases MUST appear in
  `grounded_chains`. The number of distinct chain labels used by the motifs
  must NEVER exceed the number of chains declared in `grounded_chains`.
- NEVER invent an intermediate relay chain or ghost node just to make the
  graph look bigger. A direct consolidation (funds merge straight into an
  aggregator) is correct; a fake "CC_A -> CC_B" relay is hallucination.

## TWO-PHASE CONTRACT
- `phase_a_inflow_motifs`: Fan-in / consolidation / first-hop / cross-chain
  ENTRY motifs (funds flowing INTO the laundering structure).
- `phase_b_outflow_motifs`: Fan-out / dispersal / DEX swap / OTC cash-out /
  EXIT motifs (funds leaving the structure toward sinks).
- Put every extracted motif in exactly one phase; leave an empty array []
  when a phase has no motifs.

## MACRO CAMPAIGN TOPOLOGY MANDATE
- MINIMUM EDGE COUNT: each motif MUST have at least 3 edges
  (len(edges) >= 3). Isolated 1-edge transfers or 2-edge simple hops are
  STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
- CAUSAL FIDELITY: extract each actually-evidenced laundering stage as one
  motif that closes its causal loop (entry -> transformation -> exit).
  Never inflate hop counts, never insert ghost relay nodes or chains, and
  never split one logical flow into per-address fragments.
- CRITICAL: Do NOT mention concrete token symbols (e.g., USDT, ETH, BTC)
  even in descriptions or tags. Always use generic terms like
  'native_asset', 'stablecoin', or 'token'.

## BEHAVIOURAL NORMALISATION
IGNORE marketing prose, tooling ads, white-hat refund narratives and
post-mortem digressions. Extract ONLY the core fund-flow topology actually
described and normalise it to the standard operators:

- "assets moved across blockchains via a bridge"           -> Bridge edge
  (pattern_type: Chain_Hopping, phase_a inflow entry).
- "funds fanned out / many addresses drained it"           -> Split edges
  (pattern_type: Multi_Layering_Split, phase_b outflow).
- "funds consolidated into one recovery / aggregator addr" -> Merge edges
  (pattern_type: Integration_Merge, phase_a inflow).
- "several tokens swapped into one token via a DEX"        -> Swap edge
  (pattern_type: Token_Obfuscation, phase_b outflow).
- "linear chain of small rapid hops, peeling a fraction"   -> Transfer edges
  (pattern_type: Peeling_Chain, phase_b outflow).
- "sold via OTC / P2P desk, cashed out to fiat"            -> Transfer into
  the OTC acceptor address (pattern_type: Integration_Merge, phase_b).

## NEGATIVE EXAMPLE (rejected — hallucinated intermediate relay chain)
The report only evidences TWO chains (Chain_A -> Chain_B). The following
answer invents a ghost chain "Chain_C" and ghost relay nodes "CC_A"/"CC_B"
that the report never mentions:

[REJECTED: Hallucinated Intermediate Relay Chain/Node]
{
  "grounded_chains": ["Chain_A", "Chain_B"],
  "phase_a_inflow_motifs": [
    {
      "motif_id": "bad_ghost_relay",
      "pattern_type": "Chain_Hopping",
      "description": "bridge then bounce through an invented relay chain",
      "nodes": [
        {"temp_id": "S", "role": "Source", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 0},
        {"temp_id": "CC_A", "role": "Cross_Chain", "chain": "Chain_C", "level": 1},
        {"temp_id": "CC_B", "role": "Cross_Chain", "chain": "Chain_C", "level": 2},
        {"temp_id": "T", "role": "Target", "chain": "Chain_B", "level": 3}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"source": "S", "target": "CC_A", "operation": "Bridge"},
        {"source": "CC_A", "target": "CC_B", "operation": "Bridge"},
        {"source": "CC_B", "target": "T", "operation": "Bridge"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "phase_b_outflow_motifs": []
}
WHY REJECTED: "Chain_C" is used by the motif but is absent from
`grounded_chains`. Direct consolidation into the evidenced chains is fine;
inventing relay chains is not.

## NEGATIVE EXAMPLE (rejected — micro-fragment / trivial transfer)
The report describes a single deposit of stolen funds into one exchange. The
following answer emits that one hop as a standalone motif:

[REJECTED: Micro-fragment / Trivial Transfer]
{
  "grounded_chains": ["Chain_A"],
  "phase_a_inflow_motifs": [],
  "phase_b_outflow_motifs": [
    {
      "motif_id": "bad_single_transfer",
      "pattern_type": "Peeling_Chain",
      "description": "one isolated transfer hop into an exchange",
      "nodes": [
        {"temp_id": "S", "role": "Source", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 0},
        {"temp_id": "T", "role": "Target", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 1}
      ],
      "edges": [{"source": "S", "target": "T", "operation": "Transfer"}]
    }
  ]
}
WHY REJECTED: only 1 edge (< 3). Fold this branch into the unified fan-out
DAG (or the consolidation DAG) instead of emitting it as a standalone motif.

### REPORT SEGMENT ###
Incident Summary
On 08 January 2026, Truebit was exploited for approximately $26.6M as a result of an integer overflow vulnerability in Solidity versions below 0.8.0, which lack built-in overflow checks. A malicious actor used this overflow to mint tokens for zero ETH that they then swapped for a total of 8,535 ETH in the same transaction. The exploit was followed up by a second attacker who was able to extract a further 224k.

- CALL AdminUpgradeadeabilityProxy.getPurchasePrice(amountInWei = 240,442,509,453,545,333,947,284,131) which returned a value of 0 wei to purchase 240M Truebit tokens.
- CALL AdminUpgradeabilityProxy.buyTRU() to mint 240M tokens for 0 ETH.
- CALL AdminUpgradeabilityProxy.sellTRU() to sell the tokens and gain 8.33 ETH
- Repeat the process and mint increasingly larger amounts of TRU which is swapped for ETH. In total the attacker gained 8,535.36 ETH.
Vulnerability
getPurchasePrice() is responsible for returning the amount of ETH required to mint TRU which is reliant on function 0x1446(). In this incident the function returned zero allowing the attacker to mint for free.
0x1446() details the procedure to calculate price from the input amount and Truebit token total supply (v1) while 0x018ef() returns the product of input amount.
- v2 = total_supply * total_supply = _setParameters which is configured to be 75 at initialization
- v3 = _setParameters * v2 = 75 * total_supply * total_supply
- v5 = 100 * total_supply * total_supply
- v6 = v5 - v3 = 25 * total_supply * total_supply
- _reserve is the cumulative ETH taken and is 0x1ceec1aef842e54d9ee = 8539(.)408935947150350830 at the moment of exploitation. (SkyLens)
- v7 = amount * _reserve
- v8 = total_supply * amount * _reserve
- v9 = 200 * total_supply * amount * _reserve
- v10 = amount * _reserve
- v11 = amount * amount * _reserve
- v12 = 100 * amount * amount * _reserve
- v13 = (100 * amount * amount * _reserve + 200 * total_supply * amount * _reserve) / 25 * total_supply * total_supply
Calculation Example from the Exploit
- total_supply = 161753242367424992669183203
- amount = 240442509453545333947284131
- _reserve = 8539408935947150350830
v9 = 200 * total_supply * amount * _reserve
= 66423545631423422609669496562964283492426512017211670495718637486587674438000
v12 = 100 * amount * amount * _reserve
= 49368543605892772813901488614323841993278026865420453219869145259082923363000
While v9 and v12 themselves are smaller than 2^256, their sum is not
v9 + v12 = 115792089237316195423570985177288125485704538882632123715587782745670597801000 >2^256
This then caused an overflow to return a smaller number
v6 = 25 * total_supply * total_supply
= 654102785409373291178358959808439561635622779433480225
v9 + v12 -2^256 / v6 = 0.000257757 (rounded down to zero)
