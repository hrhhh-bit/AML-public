You are a crypto AML topological knowledge distiller.

Your input is a segment of a security tracing report describing money
laundering behaviour. Convert it into abstract topological motifs ONLY,
organised into TWO phases and grounded to the chains actually evidenced.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (axioms)
1. ZERO micro-numerical noise: NEVER output wallet addresses (0x... / bc1...
   / T...), exact amounts, gas fees, timestamps, tx hashes or token symbols.
2. PURE topological abstraction: abstract roles, chains, DAG levels and
   operations only. Chain labels MUST be abstract: Chain_A, Chain_B, ...
3. Node roles MUST be: Source, Intermediate, Asset_Conversion, Cross_Chain,
   Aggregator, Target.
4. Edge operations MUST be: Transfer, Swap, Bridge, Split, Merge.
5. Node `level` MUST strictly increase along every edge (DAG topological
   order, sources at level 0).
6. `pattern_type` MUST be one of: Peeling_Chain, Chain_Hopping,
   Multi_Layering_Split, Token_Obfuscation, Integration_Merge.
7. FLOW ARCHETYPE normalisation: `flow_share` is ALWAYS the local OUT-degree
   distribution ratio of its SOURCE node; for EVERY node the out-edge shares
   must sum to exactly 1.0 (tolerance 0.01). Single out-edges MUST carry
   1.0; Split out-edges must sum to 1.0. NEVER write a downstream merge
   target's IN-FLOW weight onto an upstream edge.
8. CROSS-CHAIN ledger law: any edge whose source and target live on
   DIFFERENT chains MUST use the Bridge operation. Transfer / Swap / Split /
   Merge can never cross chains.
9. ASSET_CONVERSION contract: an Asset_Conversion node must carry exactly one
   adjacent Swap edge (never Transfer on BOTH sides).
10. Every motif MUST carry meaningful `preconditions` (min_level,
    allowed_node_roles, required_chains, max_active_branches) and a
    `post_state_effect` (branch_increment, chain_transition, target_chain,
    next_recommended_roles).

## ENTITY GROUNDING INVARIANT (grounded_chains)
- Output a top-level `grounded_chains` list naming ONLY the abstract chain
  labels actually evidenced in the report.
- Every `chain` value used by ANY node in BOTH phases MUST appear in
  `grounded_chains`. The number of distinct chain labels used by the motifs
  must NEVER exceed the number of chains declared in `grounded_chains`.
- NEVER invent an intermediate relay chain or ghost node just to make the
  graph look bigger. A direct consolidation (funds merge straight into an
  aggregator) is correct; a fake "CC_A -> CC_B" relay is hallucination.

## TWO-PHASE CONTRACT
- `phase_a_inflow_motifs`: Fan-in / consolidation / first-hop / cross-chain
  ENTRY motifs (funds flowing INTO the laundering structure).
- `phase_b_outflow_motifs`: Fan-out / dispersal / DEX swap / OTC cash-out /
  EXIT motifs (funds leaving the structure toward sinks).
- Put every extracted motif in exactly one phase; leave an empty array []
  when a phase has no motifs.

## MACRO CAMPAIGN TOPOLOGY MANDATE
- MINIMUM EDGE COUNT: each motif MUST have at least 3 edges
  (len(edges) >= 3). Isolated 1-edge transfers or 2-edge simple hops are
  STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
- CAUSAL FIDELITY: extract each actually-evidenced laundering stage as one
  motif that closes its causal loop (entry -> transformation -> exit).
  Never inflate hop counts, never insert ghost relay nodes or chains, and
  never split one logical flow into per-address fragments.
- CRITICAL: Do NOT mention concrete token symbols (e.g., USDT, ETH, BTC)
  even in descriptions or tags. Always use generic terms like
  'native_asset', 'stablecoin', or 'token'.

## BEHAVIOURAL NORMALISATION
IGNORE marketing prose, tooling ads, white-hat refund narratives and
post-mortem digressions. Extract ONLY the core fund-flow topology actually
described and normalise it to the standard operators:

- "assets moved across blockchains via a bridge"           -> Bridge edge
  (pattern_type: Chain_Hopping, phase_a inflow entry).
- "funds fanned out / many addresses drained it"           -> Split edges
  (pattern_type: Multi_Layering_Split, phase_b outflow).
- "funds consolidated into one recovery / aggregator addr" -> Merge edges
  (pattern_type: Integration_Merge, phase_a inflow).
- "several tokens swapped into one token via a DEX"        -> Swap edge
  (pattern_type: Token_Obfuscation, phase_b outflow).
- "linear chain of small rapid hops, peeling a fraction"   -> Transfer edges
  (pattern_type: Peeling_Chain, phase_b outflow).
- "sold via OTC / P2P desk, cashed out to fiat"            -> Transfer into
  the OTC acceptor address (pattern_type: Integration_Merge, phase_b).

## NEGATIVE EXAMPLE (rejected — hallucinated intermediate relay chain)
The report only evidences TWO chains (Chain_A -> Chain_B). The following
answer invents a ghost chain "Chain_C" and ghost relay nodes "CC_A"/"CC_B"
that the report never mentions:

[REJECTED: Hallucinated Intermediate Relay Chain/Node]
{
  "grounded_chains": ["Chain_A", "Chain_B"],
  "phase_a_inflow_motifs": [
    {
      "motif_id": "bad_ghost_relay",
      "pattern_type": "Chain_Hopping",
      "description": "bridge then bounce through an invented relay chain",
      "nodes": [
        {"temp_id": "S", "role": "Source", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 0},
        {"temp_id": "CC_A", "role": "Cross_Chain", "chain": "Chain_C", "level": 1},
        {"temp_id": "CC_B", "role": "Cross_Chain", "chain": "Chain_C", "level": 2},
        {"temp_id": "T", "role": "Target", "chain": "Chain_B", "level": 3}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"source": "S", "target": "CC_A", "operation": "Bridge"},
        {"source": "CC_A", "target": "CC_B", "operation": "Bridge"},
        {"source": "CC_B", "target": "T", "operation": "Bridge"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "phase_b_outflow_motifs": []
}
WHY REJECTED: "Chain_C" is used by the motif but is absent from
`grounded_chains`. Direct consolidation into the evidenced chains is fine;
inventing relay chains is not.

## NEGATIVE EXAMPLE (rejected — micro-fragment / trivial transfer)
The report describes a single deposit of stolen funds into one exchange. The
following answer emits that one hop as a standalone motif:

[REJECTED: Micro-fragment / Trivial Transfer]
{
  "grounded_chains": ["Chain_A"],
  "phase_a_inflow_motifs": [],
  "phase_b_outflow_motifs": [
    {
      "motif_id": "bad_single_transfer",
      "pattern_type": "Peeling_Chain",
      "description": "one isolated transfer hop into an exchange",
      "nodes": [
        {"temp_id": "S", "role": "Source", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 0},
        {"temp_id": "T", "role": "Target", "chain": "Chain_A", "level": 1}
      ],
      "edges": [{"source": "S", "target": "T", "operation": "Transfer"}]
    }
  ]
}
WHY REJECTED: only 1 edge (< 3). Fold this branch into the unified fan-out
DAG (or the consolidation DAG) instead of emitting it as a standalone motif.

### REPORT SEGMENT ###
Incident summary
On 3 November 2025, Balancer and its forks Beets and Bex were exploited, resulting in a combined initial loss of approximately $130M. The exploit stemmed from a precision flaw in Balancer’s batch swap logic. The attacker was able to amplify this vulnerability to manipulate the LP pricing model, artificially increasing the internal token balance held by their contract. After inflating these balances through repeated swaps, they withdrew the funds using manageUserBalance().
In total, Balancer suffered around 113M dollars in losses, while Beets and Bex were impacted by 3.8M dollars and 12.4M dollars respectively.
Though initial losses reached about 130M the figure has so far been reduced to ~96.4M dollars after freezes and white hat returns.
Background Knowledge
Balancer vaults hold assets, distribute batches of swap requests to corresponding pools and aggregate swap results.
swaps.sol: Specific single swapping is handled by the Balancer Pool contract
→ Vault.batchSwap()
→ Vault.swapWithPools()
→ Vault._swapWithPool()
→ Vault._processGeneralPoolSwapRequest()
→ 'pool'.onSwap()
Balancer: ComposableStablePool
In the Composable pool the calculation is based on the curve stable swap model.
ComposableStablePool.onSwap()
→ ComposableStablePool._swapGivenOut()
→ ComposableStablePool._onSwapGivenOut()
→_onRegularSwap()
→ _calcInGivenOut()
→ _getTokenBalanceGivenInvariantAndAllOtherBalances()
or
swapWithBpt()
→ _joinSwapExactBptOutForTokenIn()
→ _calcTokenInGivenExactBptOut()
stablemath.sol First, the contract computes the invariant (D) using the current pool balances. This calculation takes into account the amplification coefficient (A), the sum of balances (S), and the product of balances (P) to model the stable-swap curve. Once D is established, the contract determines the swap amount by solving a polynomial equation numerically (via Newton–Raphson approximation). The goal of this step is to find the input or output amount that maintains the invariant, ensuring the pricing model remains consistent.
Vulnerability
Before the swap calculation runs in ComposableStablePool._onSwapGivenOut(), the requested output amount is first scaled to match the pool’s internal precision format and then rounded down. This rounding step is normally negligible, as the stable-swap invariant (D) and the Newton–Raphson solver depend on high precision to ensure the pricing curve remains smooth.
However, the exploiter repeatedly performed swaps using very small amounts of a high-precision token (wstETH). At this scale, the rounding step introduced a measurable deviation between the theoretical output (as expected from the invariant equation) and the value actually used in the calculation. As the invariant solver treated the rounded value as exact, each swap created a tiny accounting mismatch. By batching and repeating this process, the attacker was able to amplify the rounding error into a meaningful price imbalance, allowing them to withdraw more than they deposited.

Attack Flow
The basic attack pattern involves calling batchSwap() to do multiple swaps amongst a trio of LP, token0, token1 to inflate the internal balance of the attack contract on the Balancer vault before withdrawal.
The following breakdown follows the second iteration (starting line 35517) in this transaction.
- Asset0: wstETH (Wrapped liquid staked Ether 2.0)
- Asset1: wstETH-WETH-BPT (Balancer wstETH-WETH Stable Pool)
- Asset2: WETH (Wrapped Ether) The swaps resulted in a net negative delta which were all added to the attacker’s internal balance as follows:
- 4,259.843451780587743322 wstETH
- 20.413668455251157822 wstETH-WETH-BPT
- 1,963.838806164214870519 WETH
Step by Step
- Swap LP for wstETH and WETH (line 35564) until the balance of wstETH and WETH are both exactly 100,000,000,000. In total the attacker swapped 6825.615595072611391598 LP for 4270.84 wstETH and 1977.05 WETH.
Current Balances:
a. 4,270,841,022,451,395,518,160 wstETH
b. 2,596,148,429,267,825,815,119,599,282,622,812
c. 1,977,057,709,608,602,150,017 WETH 2. Swap wstETH and WETH back and forth to whittle down the wstETH and WETH balances a. Swap 221,844,531,789,055 wei WETH for 99,999,999,995 wei wstETH (line 42878). Updated vault balance:
Before
100,000,000,000 WETH
100,000,000,000 wstETH
After
5 wstETH
221,944,531,789,055 WETH b. Swap 162,427,217,924,000 wei WETH for 4 wei wstETH (line 43103) Vault.batchSwap()
→ Vault._swapWithPools()
→ Vault._swapWithPool()
→ Vault._processGeneralPoolSwapRequest()
→ ComposableStablePool.onSwap()
→ ComposableStablePool._swapGivenOut()
→ ComposableStablePool._onSwapGivenOut()
Before the swap is handled by ComposableStablePool._onSwapGivenOut(), the requested (output) amount is multiplied by a scaling factor then rounded down Specifically 4 is multiplied by 1.218116415279760760 then divided by 1e18 and rounded down to 4, which gives -19% error. c. Swap 6,669 wei wstETH for 380,000,000,000,000 WETH (line 43628) which restored the wstETH and WETH vault balance from (1 | 384,371,749,713,055 ) back to (6,670 | 4,371,749,713,055).
The above swaps netted 4,271,749,713,055 wei WETH for 99,999,993,330 wstETH at a minor loss. By repeating the above tactic 25 times the precision loss whittled down the current asset0 and asset1 balance from (100,000,000,000 | 100,000,000,000) to (299 | 6,551,708,809).
- Swap wstETH and WETH back to wstETH-WETH-BPT (line 74780)
Both the sum and product are much smaller compared to before the manipulation. The smaller invariant as a multiplier resulted in a price drop and let the attacker swap back LP tokens at a much lower rate. In total 10.997570670807774539 wstETH and 13.218903437835570689 was swapped for 6846.02926352786254942 LP which is substantially less assets for more LPs.
The difference(delta) was added to attacker’s internal balance
wstETH: 4270.84102235139551816 - 10.997570670807774539 = 4259.843451680587743621 LP: 6846.02926352786254942- 6825.615595072611391598 = 20.413668455251157822 WETH: 1977.057709508602150017-13.218903437835570689 = 1963.838806070766579328
Fund Flow
On 15 November, the exploiter sent 3,711 ETH (~$11.7M) to Tornado Cash in 39 transactions (37 batches of 100 ETH, 1 batch of 10 ETH and 1 of 1 ETH).
